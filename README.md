## TNM085 - Roller Coaster Simulation
In the folder - "RollerCosterSim - Program" an executable file lays to play the Unity simulation. 
It should be run in windowed mode, but if run in fullscreen, ALT+F4 needs to be used in order to quit the program.


The folder "MatLab" contains the matlab code used in the project.
